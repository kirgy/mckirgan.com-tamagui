              As a senior engineer, I joined HL's Active Savings department, working in complex
              capacity between 2 departments and code infrustructure, my role was to build the
              integration layer between these large & complex systems to enable delivery of HL's new
              Cash ISA product.

              I owned the technical development of the integration layer, working with both Active
              Savings's wider team, and the general engineering teams. I had to innovate and
              proactively seek out various individuals through this large organisation to overcome
              complex integration challenges, and present them to my agile team to enable business
              to accurate forcast delivery and bring confidence to stakeholders.
